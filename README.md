# SpaceInvadersClone
Clone of Space Invaders Using SFML

Designed the structure of the game based off of the Pong lesson. 

The ship can move left and right without going off screen. A projectile is shot from the ship by pressing space and you cannot shoot again until it is destroyed or off screen again. Enemies are stored in a vector and generated in a loop. Currently in the process of getting them to move in a pattern.
